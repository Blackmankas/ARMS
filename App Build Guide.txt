ARMS App Build Guide

Cordova for Android documentation: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/

0.	Extract the project directory, ARMS.zip, to a location of your choosing
1.	Install Node.js
	a.	Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download installer (v6.10.3 LTS)
	b.	Run installer with default options
2.	Install Cordova
	a.	Open up a command line
	b.	Run command “npm install -g cordova”
3.	Test project in browser
	a.	Open up a command line
	b.	Navigate to the ARMS project directory
	c.	Run command “cordova run browser”
	d.	The app should open in a browser window. Click the scanner button and try entering an item, and 
		then click submit. Then click the home icon in the top right to return to the home screen. 
		Enter a value in the search bar and click the search button. You can then enter/modify 
		product information. The purpose for this is to ensure that the proceeding steps are 
		working correctly. In the command line window, you should see a lot of green 200 and 
		304 codes indicating that the pages of the app are loading successfully (do not worry about
		the red 404 code for /favicon.ico—but if there is a 404 for anything else, something has 
		gone wrong). Now we will move to the potentially more complicated task of building the app
		for Android.
4.	Install Java Development Kit
	a.	Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html and 
		download installer (jdk-8u131-windows-x64.exe)
	b.	Run installer with default options (note installation location—you might need it if 
		Cordova cannot find it automatically)
5.	Install Android Studio
	a.	Go to https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html and download installer (2.3.2)
	b.	Run installer with default options (note installation locations—you might need it if 
		Cordova cannot find them automatically)
6.	Build Android app with Cordova
	a.	Open up a command line
	b.	Navigate to the ARMS project directory
	c.	Run command “cordova run android”
	d.	Cordova uses two environment variables that store the location of your JDK installation and 
		your Android SDK installation, JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME respectively. Cordova will try to 
		set these environment variables itself, but if it is unable to, you will have to set them 
		manually. The default location for the JDK installation is “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121”,
		and the default location of the Android SDK is C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk”
	e.	An APK file will be generated and can be found at 
		“<project_directory>\platforms\android\build\outputs\apk”
	f.	You can install this APK to an Android device or run it on an Android emulator
7.	Clean Cordova directory
	a.	If you wish to clean the build artifacts from the project directory, open a command line, navigate to the project 			directory, and run “cordova clean”
