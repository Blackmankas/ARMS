How to build the ARMS app
-------------------------
For practical usage as an retail management system, ARMS will be run on an Android mobile device.
For ease of testing, ARMS can be deployed in a browser window with identical functionality, or to
an Android emulator. This guide will give instructions in building for both a browser and for the 
Android platform.

1. Install Node.js ( https://nodejs.org/en/ )

2. Install Cordova ( see https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted )

3. (If building for Android) Install prerequisites for Android development with Cordova, including 
	the Java Development Kit and Android Studio, according to the instructions given here:
	https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html)
	
4. If you want to deploy to an Android Emulator, you will need to set up a virtual device using Android Studio.
	To create a virtual device, follow the directions here: 
	https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html
	
5. Create a new Cordova project and add either the browser platform, the Android platform, or both,
	depending on your needs ( https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted )
	
6. Add barcode scanner plugin as follows: Navigate to the project folder and run the following command, 
	without quotes: 'cordova plugin add phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner'

	For more details about adding plugins, see https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/#add-plugins
	For details about the barcode scanner plugin, see https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner

7. Now we want to replace the default source files in the new Cordova project with the ARMS app source files.
	In the new Cordova project directory, delete the folder 'www' and the file 'config.xml'. Now, from the
	ARMS source folder, copy the 'www' folder and 'config.xml' file into the new project directory.

8. If all dependencies are set up correctly, the project should be ready to run. Use the command:
	'cordova run android' or 'cordova run browser'  ( see https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted )
	If all is well, Cordova will build the app. If you are building for browser, the app will run 
	immediately. If you are building for Android and have an Android emulator set up, Cordova will
	deploy the app to run on the emulator.

	If building for Android, an apk file will be generated, which can be used to install the app on an Android 
	device. You can find it in '<project_directory>\platforms\android\build\outputs\apk'

9. The entire build is accomplished with the 'cordova run android' (or browser) command, so a "build script" is trivial.
	Create a script/batch file with contents 'cordova run android' and save it to the root of the project directory.
