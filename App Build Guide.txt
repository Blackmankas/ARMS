How to build ARMS with Cordova
------------------------------

1. Install Cordova ( see https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted )

2. Install prerequisites for Android development with Cordova
	(see https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html)

	Getting the Android development tools working with Cordova was problematic in my experience.
	After installing Android Studio, the problems I ran into involved Cordova looking in the wrong 
	places for the gradle wrapper and for the Android build tools. You will see these errors when
	you try to build the program. Cordova will tell you what it cannot find and where it is looking.
	You may be able to resolve these issues by changing the ANDROID_HOME environment variable or by 
	copying the correct directories to the location that Cordova is searching. Google and Stackoverflow
	and such will likely help you out if you have problems with this. I was using Windows 7, for reference.

3. Create a new Cordova project and add the Android platform ( https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted )
	You may also wish to add the browser platform for testing purposes.

4. Add barcode scanner plugin as follows: Navigate to the project folder and run the following command, 
	without quotes: 'cordova add phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner'

	For more details about adding plugins, see https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/#add-plugins
	For details about the barcode scanner plugin, see https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner

5. Now we want to replace the default source files in the new Cordova project with the ARMS app source files.
	In the new Cordova project directory, delete the folder 'www' and the file 'config.xml'. Now, from the
	ARMS source folder, copy the 'www' folder and 'config.xml' file into the new project directory.

6. If all dependencies are set up correctly, the project should be ready to run. Use the command:
	'cordova run android'  ( see https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted )
	If all is well, Cordova will build the app, and if you have an Android emulator set up, it will try
	to use it to run the app immediately.

	An apk file will be generated. You can find it in '<project_directory>\platforms\android\build\outputs\apk'

7. The entire build is accomplished with the 'cordova run android' command, so a build script is trivial. Create
	a script/batch file with contents 'cordova run android' and save it to the root of the project directory.
